## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r}
library(haven)
testingdata <- read.csv("cases_deaths_and_testing_by_state.csv")
vaccinedata <- read.csv("covid19_vaccinations.csv")
data <- left_join(testingdata,vaccinedata)
View(data)
theme_set(theme_classic())
dens <- ggplot(data, aes(x=New.Deaths, color = New.Deaths)) +
  geom_density(alpha = 0.9)
deaths <- as.numeric(data$Death.Rate.per.100000)
dens
dens <- ggplot(data, aes(x=deaths, color = deaths)) +
  geom_density(color="darkblue", fill="lightblue", alpha = 0.9) +
  labs(title = "Density Curve of Deaths per 100,000 Across Every State",
       x = "Deaths per 100,000 Residents",
       y = "Density")
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
